## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This extension requires you to install the official [Exercism](https://exercism.io) client.

### Installation

You can download this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/). To build from source, simply run `npm build-dev` or use the launch scripts.

### Notes

- I am not affiliated with Exercism, Inc
- Your progress is not synced with exercism.io (you will need to manually update the status of your exercise)
- You can import/export your data if you need access to it on multiple hosts

## FAQ

**Why did you create this extension?**

I wanted a way to complete exercises during my breaks without having to leave my editor or close my current workspace.

**Does this extension intend to replace the website?**

No, the purpose of this tool is to supplement the website. Furthermore, there is no public api that provides access to profile information, making it extremely difficult to replicate online features.

**Why can't I view my profile information? Why is my progress not synced with exercism.io?**

As mentioned above, there is no available api that supports that functionality. Please read or subscribe to [#4087](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4087) for more information.
